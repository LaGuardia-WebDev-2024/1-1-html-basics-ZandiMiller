    <p>
      I wanted you to know <br />
      That I am ready to go, heartbeat <br />
      My heartbeat <br />
      I wanted you to know <br />
      Whenever you are around, can't speak <br />
      I can't speak I wanted you to know <br />
      That I am ready to go, heartbeat <br />
      My heartbeat <br />
      I wanted you to know <br />
      Whenever you are around, can't speak <br />
      I can't speak <br />
